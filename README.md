This is an app that allows you to calculate the third side of a rectangle triangle with the Pythagorean theorem. So you're searching for the third side of your rectangle triangle? Well this app is for you! Just enter the two first sides value and then hit "Calculate" and the rest is pure magic!  Have a go with this app and have some fun ;)  Cheers! The current application is still under development, and the current stage mainly tests the integrity of the interface and the correctness of logical operations. If you encounter problems during development, please contact me.
